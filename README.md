# Rookie-projects
Hi there!
Welcome to my first git repo!

the project is a getLinked ui challenge on twitter and i decided to take part in it as a rookie web developer.

I hope to share in your experience as a frontend dev and getting tips on how to improve my code's readability...

--------Rookie developer, Buike.
